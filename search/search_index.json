Here's a simple solution analyzing how the range of a projectile depends on the angle of projection. Step 1: Define the Range Formula For a projectile launched with an initial velocity \\( v_0 \\) at an angle \\( \\theta \\) (assuming launch and landing at the same height), the range \\( R \\) is given by: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] where: - \\( v_0 \\) is the initial velocity, - \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity (\u2248 9.81 m/s\u00b2), - \\( \\theta \\) is the launch angle. Step 2: Analyze the Relationship The function \\( R = \\sin(2\\theta) \\) suggests that the range depends on the sine of twice the angle. The maximum value of \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) is 1, which occurs at \\( 2\\theta = 90^\\circ \\) , meaning the maximum range happens at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . Step 3: Special Cases \\( \\theta = 0^\\circ \\) or \\( \\theta = 90^\\circ \\) : \\( R = 0 \\) (no horizontal displacement). \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) : Maximum range. Step 4: Visualization (Optional) A simple Python plot using Matplotlib can help visualize the range function: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt g = 9.81 # Gravity (m/s^2) v0 = 10 # Initial velocity (m/s) angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100) # Angle from 0 to 90 degrees radians = np.radians(angles) # Convert to radians ranges = (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * radians)) / g # Compute range plt.plot(angles, ranges) plt.xlabel(\"Launch Angle (degrees)\") plt.ylabel(\"Range (m)\") plt.title(\"Projectile Range vs. Launch Angle\") plt.grid() plt.show() Conclusion The range is symmetrical around \\( 45^\\circ \\) . The maximum range occurs at \\( 45^\\circ \\) . The function follows a sine wave pattern based on \\( \\sin(2\\theta) \\) .
